# Binary Search Tree - Inorder and Postorder Traversals
This Binary Search Tree example implements recursion to achieve both postorder traversal and inorder traversals of the BST.
Additionally, there is a removeFromRoot() method that implements the logic of removing the root node of a BST and maintaining the integrity of the tree.
